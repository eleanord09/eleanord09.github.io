   <h2>Background</h2>
   <p>
I chose to include chocolate covered cherry cookies in my recipe book because they hold a special place in my heart. Every year, my mom and I make these cookies together while watching White Christmas. This ritual has become a symbol of the start of the holiday season for my family. My mom and I make several batches throughout December. Although, we do have one exception because we make a batch for a family friend who we have Thanksgiving with because they are his favorite.  The process of making these cookies takes a while, it's not difficult but it does take a long time because there are so many steps, so it's always a nice time for my mom and I to catch up. I have been making these cookies for as long as I can remember. Although, I do think I’ve gotten better at spreading the frosting on top and making it neat throughout the years.

<p>
These cookies have also become a way to share joy with others. My mom and I make many batches each year to give to friends, neighbors, and family, and they're always a hit. I've had many of my friends ask for the recipe after receiving them. For me, these cookies are a reminder of the holiday spirit. I have many happy memories of making them with my mom and I hope to continue that over the years and maybe even eventually pass it on to my kids.

       <q>Every Christmas Eleanor and I make at least 4 batches of these cookies to give to others and they are always a hit!</q>

   <h2>Tips</h2>
<ul>
   <li>Instead of putting the chocolate frosting on the cookies before you bake them, let the cookies cool and put it on after (still follow the same directions for making the frosting). This will make the frosting shinier and neater.</li>
   <li>Before shaping the dough let it chill in the fridge for about 30 minutes. This will firm up the dough, making it easier to handle and share without it sticking to your hands. The chilled dough will also hold its shape better when baking.</li>
   <li> To give a boost of flavor, add in a teaspoon of the cherry juice into the dough. This will tie all the flavors together and make the cherry flavor a bit stronger.</li>
</ul>
