Hello! I'm Eleanor Decarmine, I'm currently a sophomore at Arlington Tech. In my freetime I like to hang out with friends, read, and listen to music. I am taking a webpage development class and learning how to code using HTML and CSS. 

This GitHub will be used to keep track of my projects and classwork for the year

Here are some of the projects I'm really proud of:

- <a href="https://eleanord09.github.io/recipes/recipe_home.html">View my recipe book</a>
- <a href="https://toemio.github.io/cosmetology/index.html">View our cosemetology page</a>
- <a href="https://kittykingdom1.wordpress.com/">View my business</a>

Here are some important links:
