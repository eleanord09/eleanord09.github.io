# Game Concept Journal Entry

## What genre will your game be?
My game will be a platformer where the player jumps from one tree branch to another. The focus is on timing and precision to land safely on each branch as the screen scrolls or branches move.

## What are the objectives? Will there be a score? How do you win or lose?
- The objective is to jump from branch to branch without falling.
- The player earns points for each successful jump.
- The game ends when the player misses a branch and falls off the screen.

## How will the player interact with the game?
- The player presses the spacebar to jump.
- Optional arrow keys can control horizontal movement in the air.
- The player must time jumps correctly to land on the next branch.

## What features will you include in your MVP?
- A character that can jump and fall
- Static or moving tree branches as platforms
- Gravity and basic physics so the player falls after jumping
- A score that increases with each successful landing
- A game over condition if the player falls
- Use of keyboard interactivity (spacebar, possibly arrow keys)
- Visual design using a circle (player), rectangles (branches), and triangle or arc (tree top/leaves)

## Concept Art
Here's what my game will look like, the player on a tree branch, with another branch above to jump to.
