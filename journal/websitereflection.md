Using WordPress to create a project focused on cat shelters has been a very interesting experience. Especially while analyzing the websites of organizations like King Street Cats, Humane Rescue Alliance, and Lost Dog Rescue. Each site uses a user-friendly design that effectively communicates their mission and engages potential adopters and supporters. I noticed that these shelters use compelling visuals and heartwarming stories about their animals, which not only capture visitors’ attention but also foster a sense of community. The ease of integrating media, such as photos and videos, within WordPress made it possible to reflect these elements in my project, enhancing its appeal and accessibility.

Throughout this project, I learned how to use various WordPress features, like customizable themes, to improve both the functionality and aesthetic. Observing the thoughtful layout of these shelters’ websites has made me appreciate the level of planning involved in creating a website for a business like an animal shelter. For example, the use of buttons to take visitors from the homepage to other informational pages. They also use pictures of cute animals to draw visitors in before explaining to them the policies of the shelter. This not only helped me understand the technical aspects of WordPress but also highlighted the importance of a well-organized layout that encourages user interaction. Overall, this experience strengthened my appreciation for how effective web design can significantly impact the success of nonprofit organizations, especially those in animal welfare.
