Using WordPress to create a project focused on cat shelters has been a very interesting experience. Especially while analyzing the websites of organizations like King Street Cats, Humane Rescue Alliance, and Lost Dog Rescue. Each site uses a user-friendly design that effectively communicates their mission and engages potential adopters and supporters. I noticed that these shelters use compelling visuals and heartwarming stories about their animals, which not only capture visitors’ attention but also foster a sense of community. I also noticed that each site I looked at had a simple structure so it’s easily accessible while still having enough information for it to be useful. The ease of integrating media, like photos in WordPress made it possible to reflect these elements in my project, increasing its appeal and accessibility.
Throughout this project, I learned how to use various WordPress features, like customizable themes, to improve both the functionality and aesthetic. Observing the thoughtful layout of these shelters’ websites has made me appreciate the level of planning involved in creating a website for a business like an animal shelter. For example, the use of buttons to take visitors from the homepage to other informational pages. They also use pictures of cute animals to draw visitors in before explaining to them the policies of the shelter so I made sure to include lots of photos throughout my website. This not only helped me understand the technical aspects of WordPress but also highlighted the importance of a well-organized layout that encourages user interaction. One thing I struggled with was editing things in the site because the theme was very constricting and there was only so much I could change. Overall, this experience strengthened my appreciation for how effective web design can significantly impact the success of nonprofit organizations, especially those in animal welfare.
