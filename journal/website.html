						<h2>Form Description</h2>
						<p>For the Join Our Class page, I created a form that lets users to enter their email address and choose their interests before subscribing. The form includes:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>Text Input (Full Name):</strong> Allows users to enter their full name.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Email Input:</strong> Ensures that users enter a valid email address.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Dropdown Selection (Interests):</strong> Users can select from learning about fundrasiers, joining our class, or beauty tips.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Submit Button:</strong> Sends the form data to the server.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>The form uses the post request method to securely send user data to the backend for processing.</p>
						<h2>Reflection on the Development Process</h2>
						<p>This project involved collaboration with my partneers, requiring communication and version control using Git. Below are some key takeaways:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>Code Sharing:</strong> Sharing code through GitHub worked well, but we had to coordinate to avoid conflicts. We discussed our changes before pushing updates.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Pulling and Merging:</strong> At first, we encountered some merge conflicts due to changes at the same time in shared files. We resolved them by carefully reviewing conflicting lines and maintaining consistency.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Branch-Based Development:</strong> Creating separate branches for features was extremely helpful. Using pull requests allowed for code reviews before merging, improving code quality and preventing accidental overwrites.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Overall, this project reinforced my understanding of HTML forms, Git workflows, and collaborative development. It also highlighted the importance of clear documentation and structured communication in a team project.</p>
