# My journey of learning the terminal

I'm feeling pretty good about learning terminal,I understand everything we learn by the end of class. Although sometimes I struggle to remember it for next class so I have to review it. I am writing little notes to myself about important commands so I can review those throughout the week and that has been really helpful. 

We are using terminal to make and control everything about out website. We are using git to store our webiste and keep a record of changes we have made. We are using vim to edit our website. We are using Markdown to add to our journal entries and add text to our websites. 

I would reccomend to future students to write notes to themself. As I mentioned before I like to jot down the important commands in my notes app and review them throughout the week so that I'm sure I remember them. I would also tell them that sometimes it takes a bit for this to make sense so be patient. 


# Reflection for encryption and decryption

Symmetric encryption uses the same key for encryption and decryption. Asymmetric encryption uses two different keys, one public key for encryption and another private key for decryption.. Symmetric encryption is less secure than asymmetric encryption because there is only one key so if it is compromised the date can easily be decrypted. Unlike asymmetric where there are two keys so there is another layer of protection on the information. 

How to Encrypt a Message: First, ensure that you are working inside your git repository. Then, download and run the encryption. Next, run the encryption script and add your partner's GitHub username, enter your secret message and encrypt the message and save it to your computer. Next, check to make sure the script ran successfully by seeing if the necessary files are in the RSA folder. Lastly commit the files to the Git repository and then push the changes to the Git repository. 

How to Decrypt the Received Message: First, down and run the description script provided. Next, download your partner's encrypted message by going to their GitHub repository and downloading their file and saving it into your receive folder. Then, run the decryption script provided. Next, make sure the message was decrypted, it will automatically output the message and save it. Lastly, add, commit and push the message into your Git repository. 

It's important to never share your secret key because that means your key has been compromised and someone else could see your encrypted messages. Its especially dangerous if your using symmetric encryption because there is only one code.
