# Reflection for encryption and decryption

Symmetric encryption uses the same key for encryption and decryption. Asymmetric encryption uses two different keys, one public key for encryption and another private key for decryption.. Symmetric encryption is less secure than asymmetric encryption because there is only one key so if it is compromised the date can easily be decrypted. Unlike asymmetric where there are two keys so there is another layer of protection on the information. 

How to Encrypt a Message: First, ensure that you are working inside your git repository. Then, download and run the encryption. Next, run the encryption script and add your partner's GitHub username, enter your secret message and encrypt the message and save it to your computer. Next, check to make sure the script ran successfully by seeing if the necessary files are in the RSA folder. Lastly commit the files to the Git repository and then push the changes to the Git repository. 

How to Decrypt the Received Message: First, down and run the description script provided. Next, download your partner's encrypted message by going to their GitHub repository and downloading their file and saving it into your receive folder. Then, run the decryption script provided. Next, make sure the message was decrypted, it will automatically output the message and save it. Lastly, add, commit and push the message into your Git repository. 

It's important to never share your secret key because that means your key has been compromised and someone else could see your encrypted messages. It's especially dangerous if your using symmetric encryption because there is only one code.
