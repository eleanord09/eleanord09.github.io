							<h2>Project 1: Design a Business</h2>
							<p>
                In this project, we were tasked with coming up with a business and designing a website for it.
                My business was called "Kitty Kingdom" and is a cat adoption center. We used multiple webpages 
                to explain the services our business offered and designed it on WordPress. There was no coding 
                in this project; instead, we used it to understand how to design websites and what components 
                were needed.
            </p>

                Visit the website here:

						<h2>Project 2: My Recipe Book</h2>
						<p>
                In this project, we made a recipe book consisting of two recipes that are special to us. 
                I chose to add a recipe for pasta sauce from my grandma and cookies that my mom and I make every year. 
                In this project, we coded every aspect of the website. The challenge was to make the website functional 
                while still making it visually appealing.
