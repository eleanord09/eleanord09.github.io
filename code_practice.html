		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p> The TCP/IP model is a conceptual framework used to understand and describe how data is transmitted across a network. It stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, and it is the basis for how communication occurs over the internet.</p>
		<h2>Steps to Understand the TCP/IP Model</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Start by understanding the layers involved in the TCP/IP model.</li>
    <li>Learn the functions of each layer.</li>
    <li>Understand how data is transmitted through each layer.</li>
    <li>Analyze common protocols used at each layer.</li>
    <li>Learn about the interrelationship between the layers.</li>
  </ol>
		<h2>Key Features of the TCP/IP Model</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>It is a concise, four-layered model for networking.</li>
    <li>It is designed to work across diverse networks.</li>
    <li>The model supports multiple protocols.</li>
    <li>Each layer handles specific tasks in the communication process.</li>
  </ul>
	 <h2>TCP/IP Layers</h2>
        <p>The TCP/IP model consists of four layers:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Application Layer</strong> - Responsible for end-user services like email, file transfer, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Transport Layer</strong> - Manages end-to-end communication and data flow control.</li>
            <li><strong>Internet Layer</strong> - Handles the addressing and routing of data across the network.</li>
            <li><strong>Link Layer</strong> - Deals with the physical transmission of data over the network.</li>
        </ol>
		<h2>Layer Functions</h2>
        <p>Each layer in the TCP/IP model has specific functions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Application Layer</strong> - Protocols like HTTP, FTP, and DNS operate here.</li>
            <li><strong>Transport Layer</strong> - Protocols like TCP and UDP are used to ensure data reaches its destination.</li>
            <li><strong>Internet Layer</strong> - Protocols like IP (Internet Protocol) help route data from one computer to another.</li>
            <li><strong>Link Layer</strong> - Protocols like Ethernet are responsible for the physical network connections.</li>
        </ul>
		<h2>Using the Layers in Practice</h2>
        <p>When you're working with the TCP/IP model, you might use various commands and tools to interact with the layers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><kbd>ping</kbd> - Check if a remote host is reachable (operates at the Internet Layer).</li>
            <li><kbd>tracert</kbd> - Trace the path data takes to reach a remote host (operates at the Internet Layer).</li>
            <li><kbd>netstat</kbd> - View active network connections and sockets (works at the Transport Layer).</li>
        </ul>

  <h2>Keyboard Input Example</h2>
  <p>To check your network settings using the command prompt, press <kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> to open the Run window, then type <code>cmd</code> and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.</p>

		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Understanding the TCP/IP model is very important for network administrators, developers, and anyone interested in how the internet works. Each layer plays a unique role in ensuring that data can travel from one device to another, and learning about these layers helps you troubleshoot network issues and optimize communication between devices.</p>
